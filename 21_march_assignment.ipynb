    "- Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two common methods for encoding categorical variables into numerical values.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- Ordinal encoding\n",
    "    - It is a technique where the categories of a categorical variable are assigned integers based on their order or rank.\n",
    "    - Example\n",
    "        - If we have a categorical variable \"Size\" with categories \"Small\", \"Medium\" and \"Large\", we might assign the values 1, 2 and 3 respectively to represent their relative order.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- Label encoding\n",
    "    - It is a technique where the categories of a categorical variable are assigned a unique integer value.\n",
    "    - Example\n",
    "        - If we have a categorical variable \"Color\" with categories \"Red\", \"Green\" and \"Blue\", we might assign the values 1, 2 and 3 respectively to each category.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- One major difference between the two encoding methods is that ordinal encoding considers the order of the categories, while label encoding does not.\n",
    "- Therefore, ordinal encoding is suitable for variables with a clear order or ranking, such as \"Size\" or \"Grade\", while label encoding is appropriate for variables without any intrinsic order, such as \"Color\" or \"Gender\".\n",
    "#\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "    - If we have a dataset of students with their grades in different subjects, we can use ordinal encoding to represent the grades from \"A\" to \"F\" as 1 to 6 respectively.\n",
    "    - If we have a dataset of animals with their colors, we can use label encoding to represent the colors as 1 for \"Red\", 2 for \"Green\", and 3 for \"Blue\"."

    "#\n",
    "- The process involves the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Group the data by the categorical variable and calculate the mean of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "    2. Sort the categories based on the mean of the target variable in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "    3. Assign an integer value to each category based on their rank.\n",

One of the categorical variables is \"Education\", with categories \"High School\", \"College\", \"Graduate\", and \"Post-graduate\". We can use target guided ordinal encoding to encode the variables."
